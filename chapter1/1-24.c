   Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors
   like unmatched parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about
   quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments.
   (This program is hard if you do it in full generality. */

// Like they said, this one is ticky to do "in full generality", especially
// with the amount of  C learned so far. Will come back to.
