   "How would you test the word count program? What kinds of inputs are most likely
   to uncover bugs if there are any?"
   
   I would test for these scenarios:
   - Words separated by one space
   - Words seperated by multiple spaces
   - Words separated by tabs
   - Words separated by newlines
   - Words separated by a combination of the above. */
