Solutions from "The C Programming Language"
================================================

While I've learned a fair amount of C++ in school, I've realized my basic C Knowledge is lacking. I've thus decided to read through all of "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie, and do all of the excercises they recommend. For fun and glory!

I'm going to try and use only the tools taught up to that point in K&R when writing these, even if I know an easier way, or some sort of library that will do it for me.

It doesn't look like there's anything particularly difficult, but it should help both my rusty C++ and my meager C skills.
